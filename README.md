A simple, performant minimap mod for Forge, designed for Minecraft 1.18.1.

The current state of the mod is as far as is necessary for the goals of the mod, however I will accept bug reports or feature requests if anybody actually uses this mod!

The current placeholder mod logo is the Minecraft map texture - all credits to Mojang/Microsoft for that artwork.
